Why I moved to China

0:00

hey everyone I'm Ben Norton and this is geopolitical economy report usually here

0:07

I analyze the latest geopolitical and economic developments in the world and

0:13

I'm going to be doing that today a bit later but this is a special episode and today I'm going to be talking about my

0:20

experience in China I recently made a huge life change and I moved to China I

0:28

have been living in Beijing for a bit over a month I have not been here a super long time but I wanted to make a

0:35

video reflecting on what I have already learned being here several weeks now I'm

0:41

not changing the direction of this channel I'm going to continue to do the

0:46

original reporting and Analysis on geopolitics and economics that I've always done here talking about other

0:52

regions of the world this is not going to become a channel where I only make videos about my experience in China and

1:00

the places I visit there are already several great channels that do that kind of work I came here because I wanted to

1:07

actually understand what China is like on the inside because the only way to

1:12

really understand a country is to visit it and in particular to spend time not just a few days not even just a few

1:19

weeks to spend a few years living in that country that's my plan I also plan

1:24

on doing a PhD in economics in particular focused on development economics I want to learn more about

1:31

China's economic policies which have been remarkable I mean China has overseen the most incredible economic

China's remarkable economic growth

1:38

growth in human history I'll be talking about that today it has gone from one of the poorest countries on the planet to

1:46

lifting more than 800 million people out of poverty in fact according to World

1:53

Bank data China was responsible for 34 of all of the world's reduction ction in

2:00

extreme poverty since the 1980s and when you look at the gradual decline in

2:06

global inequality inequality between countries you see that if you remove China from the data there is no change

2:14

and today China has the world's largest economy larger even than the US economy

2:20

these are all things that I'm going to be discussing today in further detail and the first thing that I really want

The most sovereign country?

2:26

to stress today is I think that China could be the most sovereign country on

2:32

the planet now I will go into much greater detail later today discussing

2:38

what I mean by that but it's really incredible I mean when you think about all the propaganda demonizing China as

2:45

this horrible authoritarian dystopia where the government wants to control everything what you actually realize is

2:51

that this is a country that went through a period of partial colonization the century of humiliation as it's known in

2:59

which numerous foreign powers invaded and even controlled parts of the country

3:04

including Japan including European countries including the US Britain and

3:10

France invaded China in 1860 and burnt down the Summer Palace and in fact you

3:16

can go visit the Summer Palace here in China and see the ruins of the palace that was burnt down by the European

3:22

Invaders then in 1900 China was invaded Again by the so-called eight Nation

3:29

Alliance which included the European powers the US and Japan they occupied

3:35

the capital Beijing that was just over a hundred years ago and in the span of the

3:41

thousands of years of Chinese history that was very recent so these acts of

3:46

foreign intervention and attacks and the Opium Wars and all of these problems are

3:52

things that very much are in the historical consciousness here in China

3:57

that people very much remember and don't want to repeat this has all LED China to

4:03

create a very unique political and economic model and by the way Beijing

4:09

has no interest whatsoever in imposing that model on other countries and China

4:15

has prioritized sovereignty technological sovereignty economic

4:20

sovereignty food sovereignty these are all things that China has been able to develop in the past several decades in a

4:28

way that I think no other country on Earth has been able to do so I'll explain this more in detail later but

Technological sovereignty

4:34

here's a very brief summary if you travel to many countries all across the

4:40

planet you see that the technology they use is produced by W Western

4:45

corporations especially us corporations from Silicon Valley all of the apps they use are from us companies on Silicon

4:52

Valley so whether that's for communications not only social media and news communication but also for for

4:59

instance email you know how many people use Gmail all around the world these are companies that have close relations with

5:05

the US government they are contractors with the US government or if you look for instance at the the actual

5:11

technology that is produced like cell phones or computers a lot of this also comes from us companies many of which

5:18

are US government contractors in China that's not the case all of the apps that are used in everyday life are sovereign

5:26

Chinese apps they don't belong to us corporations on Silicon Valley that work with the Pentagon much of the physical

5:33

technology is also Chinese whether that's the phones are Chinese the computers are Chinese even the cars are

5:40

increasingly Chinese and other forms of transportation they can produce all of that locally they don't rely on foreign

5:46

firms and in particular us corporations that are part of the military-industrial complex if you travel to many countries

5:52

on Earth you can see how dependent they are on Silicon Valley on the US but

5:59

China is not like that and not only are those Technologies produced by Chinese firms but every part of the supply chain

6:06

is located physically in China China can make sure that those parts of the supply

6:12

chain are not cut off by foreign countries that might want to destabilize

6:17

it like we see now with the growing geopolitical tensions between the US and China this cannot be said for many other

6:23

countries including the US by the way which is completely dependent on major

6:28

parts of the supply chain located in other countries including in China which has led to discussion of economic

6:36

decoupling and friend Shoring and all of these these buzzwords that we hear today

6:41

in economic discussions but the point is the the point I really need to stress that I'll be exploring in much greater

6:48

detail later on is that China is Sovereign in a way that I think no other country is Sovereign in and that's not

6:54

something we think a lot about it's not very intuitive especially if you haven't come here and seen the country with your

7:00

own eyes but it is so important and it also helps us to understand Chinese

7:06

government policy and the Western portrayals of China that that portray

7:12

China as trying to control everything and censor everything when you actually think about it through the lens of

7:18

sovereignty and trying to defend its national interests against the long

7:24

history of foreign meddling you can understand a lot of Chinese policy China

7:30

is Sovereign in so many ways not just technologically not just economically not just politically these are all

7:36

things that I'm going to be exploring today in this analysis but I also want to talk about why I decided to move here

Dangers of a new cold war

7:44

I think we're in a very tragic and dangerous historical moment in a new

7:49

Cold War the United States has taken very aggressive policies against China

7:56

numerous US government officials have made it clear that they want to overthrow the Chinese government just as

8:02

the US was involved in overthrowing the Soviet government in 1991 in Russia

8:09

Washington and some European capitals have also imposed sanctions on Chinese

8:15

companies and government officials and different institutions and this is all leading in a very dangerous Direction

8:23

there are many people warning of the possibility of war in fact some us generals are openly saying that they're

8:29

preparing for Waging War on China this is all tragic because it is totally

8:36

preventable it is not necessary I truly believe in the possibility of promoting

8:42

peaceful cooperation mutually beneficial development these are all things that

8:48

could be on the table if the US largely but also some European countries could

8:54

abandon this very aggressive policy that seeks to try to contain and weaken and

9:01

destabilize China so I think in this moment it is very important to have

9:06

people who have an English language audience who are from the West to come here to China to see what it life is

9:14

actually like on the ground to be able to see with your own eyes if the Western

9:19

media is telling the truth about China because this is really the only way of

9:25

understanding what a country actually is like is visiting and also want to stress because of course I'm going to be

An unnecessary disclaimer

9:31

attacked by critics who always like to resort to cheap ad hominum attacks who

9:37

claim that I'm a propagandist for China or I'm a shill for China which is ridiculous yes I am living here now but

9:44

I have no links whatsoever to the Chinese government I'm completely independent I will stress that I am not

9:51

working for a Chinese media Outlet I am not getting paid by the Chinese

9:56

government I am completely independent as a journalist yes I do plan on doing a PhD but I mean

10:02

studying in a foreign country doesn't make you a tool of that foreign country's government there are a lot of

10:07

people who go to the United States or go to the UK to study and I wanted to do a PhD in economics and I didn't want to do

10:13

it in a western country precisely because there is so much bias against

10:19

countries like China and much of the global South there still is this very kind of colonial perspective many

10:25

programs are very dogmatic now I shouldn't have to say any of this it's ridiculous that I have to give these

10:32

kinds of disclaimers but I mentioned that we're in a very toxic environment

10:37

of a new Cold War and anyone who criticizes Western narratives about

10:43

countries like China or Russia or other Global South targets were often

10:48

demonized and called propagandists and smeared without any evidence and you have these ridiculous ad homm attacks

10:54

and it's it just it does not help you to understand the world all that does is encourages xenophobia and tries to get

11:02

people in the west to to close their minds off to the rest of the world to see China and other foreign countries as

11:09

these boogey men that we need to be afraid of and ultimately the goal tragically is about manufacturing

11:15

consent for more and more aggressive policies that could lead to war of course War could be catastrophic and

11:22

that's why it is so important to speak out against this propaganda and to

11:28

understand what's

11:34

happening being here in China one of the first things that really strikes you of

Unprecedented economic development

11:40

course if you're just visiting but also if you're living here is the level of development now I really must stress

11:47

this fact China's Economic Development has no parallel in human history it is absolutely remarkable in the 1940s when

11:55

China still had a feudal system with an Emperor and it was still partially colonized by foreign powers the average

12:03

person only lived until their 30s depends on the estimates you look at but

12:08

between 32 and 35 years but if you fast forward to today China's life expectancy

12:15

is now 78 Which is higher than the life expectancy in the United States which is

12:22

only 76 and by the way the US life expectancy is dropping whereas China's

12:27

continues to rise that's not the only incredible indicator another example is simply the size of

12:35

the economy GDP consists of the goods and services produced in a given economy

12:41

sometimes it abuse Gates more than it clarifies so I do have some criticisms of it that'll be talking about in a

12:47

moment but GDP is the metric most commonly used by economists and when you look at the US GDP compared to China

12:55

China's economy actually overtook the United States in 2018 and China today has the world's

13:03

largest economy when you measure its GDP at purchasing power parody which is the

13:09

best way to measure the size of an economy because instead of just converting every all the prices in the

13:15

economy to Dollars which would be nominal GDP which doesn't make sense because in a country like China you

13:21

don't use dollars they have their own currency and as I'll talk about later China's a currency the renin is actually

13:27

very much under under valued you can buy a lot with very few Yuan compared to

13:33

dollars so what that really means is if you only converted to dollars you don't actually get a real understanding of the

13:40

size of the economic power of the Chinese economy if you measure it in purchasing power parody you can see that

13:45

actually it is the world's largest economy and continues to grow this year

13:51

growth estimates are over 5% and this is despite you know all these Western media Outlets claiming that the Chinese

13:57

economy is in a crisis Isis it continues to grow certainly much more quickly than the US economy and other Western

14:04

economies but the point is China has the world's largest economy however it is

14:10

true that part of that is because China is such a massive country with more than

14:17

1.4 billion people so it has four times the US population of more than 330

14:23

million people in order to adjust for the population you have to look at GDP per cap which is the measurement of all

14:30

of the goods and services produced in an economy divided by the population and there you can see that China still has a

14:37

lot of room for development compared to the wealthy Western countries like the

14:43

United States and other European countries although I should stress that those countries developed through

14:49

colonialism hundreds of years of colonialism the Indian Economist UTA

14:55

patnik has estimated that the British Empire Cy out more than $45 trillion of

15:02

wealth just from India when India was a British colony not to mention the other

15:07

colonies of Britain and the other European powers so that money that

15:12

Capital that was extracted from the colonies was then used to industrialize

15:17

and to develop these economies China did not develop through colonialism and of course China itself was a victim of

15:25

colonialism not to the same degree as India but it was partially colonized and

15:30

invaded and attacked and exploited by numerous foreign Colonial Powers so China has really had to catch up

15:37

economically with development however when we do this comparison once again it can Abus gate more than it clarifies a

15:45

much better comparison is not apples to oranges but Apples to Apples rather you

15:50

should look at China's Economic Development compared to other countries in the global South that were colonized

15:57

so for instance India got independence from British colonialism in 1947 which

16:02

also led to the creation of Pakistan and China had its revolution in 1949

16:08

overthrowing this feudal regime and ending the century of humiliation so these Global South countries came from

16:15

similar levels of development in the 1940s and China has developed significantly more rapidly than the

16:23

economies of India or Pakistan or other nations so clearly they were doing something different their economic model

16:29

was fundamentally different and even as recently as the 1980s the per capita GDP measured to

16:38

purchasing power parody of China was lower than the per capita GDP of Haiti

16:47

of Honduras of Sudan these are some of the poorest countries on Earth so China

16:53

has gone from one of the poorest countries on Earth to today having an economy that is larger than the US

17:00

economy how did it do that well I actually have another video in which I talk about China's unique development

17:07

model of socialism with Chinese characteristics I will link to that in the description below I go into much

17:13

greater detail but this is where another example of where GDP sometimes obuse

17:19

Gates more than it clarifies because if you look at the United States for instance a lot of GDP comes from the

17:26

financial sector it comes from specul pumping up big bubbles with asset price

17:32

inflation to pump up the value of stocks and bonds and real estate and this has

17:37

led to you know big crises like the 2008 financial crash because of subprime

17:43

mortgages and this house of cards that the banking system was built on or the

17:48

2000.com bubble and then if you look at other sectors of the economy you can see for instance that 18% of the GDP comes

17:57

from Health Care spending and yet the US spends so much money on health care and

18:03

has some of the worst results out of all of the rich industrialized countries so

18:08

just because you spend a lot of money in your economy doesn't mean that you're actually being productive with the use

18:15

of those resources and we can see this clearly with de-industrialization in the United

18:20

States China has become the factory of the world China produces everything as

18:26

I'll be discussing today and and China today represents nearly onethird of

18:32

global manufacturing production whereas the US represents just over

18:38

15% half of China's industrial production the US economy has

18:44

financialized over time under the neoliberal economic model that Rose in

18:49

the 1980s and this has led to the move toward the service sector the move away

18:55

from manufacturing it has led to de- Industrial ization in significant parts of the US and this is Left Behind

19:02

impoverished areas like the Rust Belt if you're only fixated on GDP you can miss

19:08

the forest for the trees and not see the fundamental differences in the US

19:14

economic model which is based on financial speculation pumping up bubbles of asset price inflation and the Chinese

19:22

model which is fundamentally based on productive investment in manufacturing

19:27

in producing things that people all around the world need for their daily lives and this brings me to the main

China's unique sovereignty

19:34

point that I wanted to stress today which is the issue of sovereignty I

19:39

really think living here in China and experiencing life here that you can say that China is probably the most

19:47

sovereign country on Earth why do I say that well a lot of people in Western

19:52

countries don't really think much about sovereignty because they don't have a history of their sovereignty being

19:58

violated by foreign powers because the Western Nations developed again economically through colonialism they

20:04

were the colonial powers that violated the sovereignty of global South Nations

20:10

that they colonized so that's one way of thinking about sovereignty which is not the best way I'm going to talk about

20:16

another way in a second but it is true that one way of having sovereignty like the colonial powers in the west have is

20:23

through this this history of colonialism and violating the sovereignty of other countries using military might to impose

20:32

your own sovereignty and this is not just ancient history we can look at the United States today and see that yes the

20:38

US is a very sovereign country because it violates the Sovereign of so many other countries and imposes its will on

20:46

much of the world the United States has meddled in countries all over planet

20:52

Earth and the US has invaded many countries like Iraq and Afghanistan it

20:58

has bombed and waged War on many other countries like Vietnam and Korea and

21:05

Yemen and Syria and Libya the list goes on the US has organized coups to

21:12

overthrow democratically elected governments in dozens of countries I mean I could spend all day discussing

21:20

the foreign us interventions this is something that I do discuss a lot here at geopolitical economy report so you

21:26

can go check out other videos and articles for that analysis but the point is China has not done that so us

21:34

sovereignty is based on simply Imperial power threats of military invasions the

21:40

use of military force economic threats the use of sanctions trying to cut off

21:47

countries from accessing the international financial institutions like the IMF and the World Bank like the

21:54

interbank messaging system Swift China doesn't do any of that China has developed its own Sovereign institutions

22:02

through its own Economic Development so the political and economic models are completely different they're

22:09

antithetical so a lot of people in the west don't think about how important it is for your country to be Sovereign for

22:15

it to be able to produce the food and commodities and technology that it needs

22:22

to to to have a functioning economy instead especially in the age of

22:28

neoliberal globalization so many countries are dependent on other

22:33

countries this is especially true on the global South but it's also true for

22:38

increasingly Western countries themselves and we can see for instance with the supply chain shocks that

22:46

happened during the pandemic with disruption to the supply chains people realize if you rely so much on other

22:53

countries for the production of Commodities that you need then if the those countries can't produce it or they

22:59

decide not to produce it you can see that it causes inflation it causes shortages it causes major economic

23:06

problems in your own country China has understood the importance of this and China has engaged in industrial policy

23:14

and planning in a way where every single part of the global supply chain is

23:20

located in China China can basically produce almost anything that it needs to

23:27

survive that it's economy needs that it its people need to live everyday normal lives this is of course directly related

De-industrialization

23:34

to the issue of manufacturing and the issue the problem in the US of

23:40

de-industrialization this is why certain US government officials like for instance the Biden administration's

23:46

National Security advisor Jake Sullivan gave a historic speech in which he acknowledged that neoliberal

23:53

globalization had eroded us Supply chains and industrial production and

23:58

this is a national security threat because the US can't it simply cannot produce many things that it needs not

24:05

only for everyday life but that it's military needs China understood this from day one and this is why you know a

24:11

lot of the western attacks on China calling it authoritarian and say saying that it wants to censor everything and

24:17

control everything it's often misunderstanding no no no no China was always careful to try to make sure that

24:24

it was Sovereign that it was protected that it was not overly dependent on foreign countries so it could

24:30

actually defend itself its territorial integrity and its National Security so

24:36

this brings me back to the idea of sovereignty and thinking about it in a different way which is economic

24:41

sovereignty I want to look specifically at some examples that I've seen in my experience here in China so people can

China's sovereign social media space

24:48

understand what I mean when I say China is probably the most sovereign country on Earth well here's an example I spent

24:54

a lot of time living in and traveling in Latin America and yet in Latin America

25:00

there are a lot of governments that have revolutionary projects challenging the neoc colonialist policies of the US and

25:07

the Monroe Doctrine the long history of the US meddling and their Internal Affairs and they have achieved a lot in

25:14

terms of defending their sovereignty their political sovereignty in some ways their economic sovereignty but one way

25:21

in which many countries on Earth including even countries with revolutionary governments don't have

25:27

sovereignty is technological sovereignty what do I mean by that well look for instance at Cuba the US has tried to use

25:35

social media applications which are owned by Silicon Valley corporations

25:41

which also happen to be US government contractors Washington has long tried to use these social media platforms to

25:48

destabilize Cuba spreading propaganda spreading fake news this is what

25:53

originally led the Cuban government to actually ban many of those applications so in return the US government created

26:01

its own Twitter alternative called sunsun which it funded and then used to

26:06

spread propaganda once again fake news disinformation to try to destabilize the Cuban government there are many examples

26:13

of the Pentagon and the state department using these social media platforms as

26:19

tools geopolitical tools to try to destabilize foreign adversaries and yet

26:25

in a lot of countries in Latin America and other countries on Earth all across the planet everyone uses YouTube

26:33

everyone uses Facebook everyone uses Instagram which by the way belongs to

26:39

meta which is the parent company of Facebook and by the way all across the global South one of the most popular

26:45

apps is WhatsApp WhatsApp is also the property of meta the parent company of

26:51

Facebook and Instagram and meta of course has billions of dollars of contracts with the the US government so

26:59

these Silicon Valley corporations are closely linked to the US government Washington uses them to spy on foreign

27:05

countries we know that the US has even used these kinds of applications to spy on foreign heads of state including of

27:13

allies like European allies who are spied on by the United States but in

27:18

China the US can't do that because they don't use those apps instead of WhatsApp

27:24

everyone uses WeChat that's the most common way to communicate with people you can also use it for payment and

27:30

other applications within WeChat people don't use YouTube that much either instead they use billyb Billy which is a

27:38

Chinese video hosting platform instead of Facebook and Twitter they have wayo

27:44

and then of course you have Tik Tok which is becoming very popular all around the world although this is a very

27:50

important point that I should stress here in China in mainland China Tik Tok is actually not the app that people use

27:57

they there's a separate Mainland Chinese version of the app which is called duin which is which is a separate company

28:04

from Tik Tok and by the way as the CEO of Tik Tok pointed out when he was being

28:10

grilled in a US Congressional briefing Tik Tok is actually based in the US in

28:15

California and in Singapore not in China and the CEO of Tik Tok is Singaporean

28:21

he's not Chinese but the point once again is that China has its own social

28:27

media apps and social media is just barely scratching the surface let's think about email think about how

China's sovereign technological space

28:33

important email is not just for average people but for governments for companies every institution every organization

28:40

needs digital communication and so many people around the world use Gmail which

28:46

is of course Google it's owned by Google and as is often said never forget if a

28:53

product is free in scare quotes that's because you are the product product when we're talking about these Silicon Valley

28:59

companies the reason Gmail and all these other applications are free is because you are the product your data is being

29:07

collected by these companies they sell your data to advertising firms the US

29:13

government uses that data itself for Mass surveillance so you know when Washington accuses Beijing of

29:19

surveillance and all these things it's exactly what the US government has been doing and not only on people in the US

29:25

but people all around the world I as a journalist have organized interviews

29:30

with government officials and their their offices have emailed me using

29:36

Gmail accounts so think about how much of a national security threat that is

29:41

these are governments including upper levels of governments all around the world that are using Google's mail

29:49

service and Google is a contractor with the CIA Google's a contractor with the Pentagon Google is inextricably linked

29:56

to the the US government in China people don't use Google Google Google is

30:02

blocked here they have QQ they have many other services that provide mail and

30:08

provide many other applications another example is Maps so Google maps of course

30:14

is very popular well Google Maps is blocked in China instead they have their own Maps applications like Buu and by

30:22

the way I should point out that these us apps like Google Maps also use GPS and

30:29

GPS is not a neutral technology GPS is the US government GPS was created by the

30:36

US Military and still today who runs who operates who oversees GPS it's the US

30:43

Department of Defense GPS is part of the US government so instead China developed

30:50

its own alternative to GPS which is called B do so China once again it's

30:57

Sovereign technologically it doesn't need to rely on the US military to have

31:03

geoca of not only its military but of everything else that's happening inside

31:08

China and around the world it has its own technological Sovereign capacity in a way that many other countries don't

31:15

have another example of this goes back to WeChat which is what I mentioned we've seen all across the world the move

Digitalization of the economy

31:22

toward the digitization of the economy so instead of using physical cash more and more we're using cards and in some

31:29

countries like China not even cards anymore but rather QR codes and simply

31:35

scanning your phone right and the most common apps for payment are WeChat and

31:42

alipe not not PayPal not us firms now there is all across the planet a move

31:49

toward digitization digital payments so India for instance has a really big drive that has been pushing for people

31:56

to pay with their phone using QR codes like in China the argument made which

32:01

you know has an element of Truth is that there are a lot of people who are in the informal economy many poor and

32:07

workingclass people they don't have bank accounts they don't receive paychecks so the digitization of the economy is a way

32:14

to help get them more involved in the formal economy and it can be helpful for

32:19

a lot of people in particular in rural areas however if you look at a lot of the apps that are being used there are

32:25

some domestic apps but you know one of the main competitors that's trying to take over that market Amazon so we see

32:32

around the world in countries that are trying to develop this technology us

32:37

monopolies like Amazon are trying to take over these markets and essentially

32:43

colonize the these digital spaces China's digital space and technological space is not colonized China is fully

32:50

Sovereign in fact another example of this is Amazon itself so China also has

32:56

its own own local firms for people to buy things online the most popular is tauo which is again a Chinese

33:03

application it's not Amazon now Amazon did try to get access to the Chinese

33:08

market and you know what happened it basically didn't really work first of all China requires All Foreign firms

33:15

like Amazon to partner with local Chinese firms and often to have Equity

33:21

owned by Chinese investors so they're partially Chinese companies once again

33:26

defending economic sovereignty but even beyond that Amazon basically failed to

33:32

get a significant part of the market share in China because once again the

33:38

technological space and the digital space in China is not colonized and as we I was talking about

33:45

the history of colonialism well we also need to think not just about physical colonization but also about economic

33:52

colonization technological colonization digital colonization China is Sovereign

33:58

in these spaces in a way that many countries are not sovereign and as we move toward increasingly digitized

34:05

economies these discussions are going to become more and more important and by the way when I talk about technological

Phones

34:11

sovereignty it's not just about the software it's also about the hardware

34:16

and so for instance the phones that we use these applications on if you walk around China the vast majority of the

34:23

phones are made by Chinese firms not foreign firms of course a lot of people

34:29

know about Huawei largely because the United States has been waging an economic war against Huawei imposing

34:36

sanctions trying to prevent Huawei from developing Huawei phones are very

34:41

popular and very good phones by the way but it's not just Huawei there are also many other great Chinese phone companies

34:48

like xiaomi like Oppo there are many others and if you walk around in China you can see them everywhere you go and

34:56

by the way the telecommunications companies in China are state-owned they're not run as parasitical for

35:05

profit corporations like Verizon or AT&T these big corporate monopolies or

35:11

oligopolies like Verizon or AT&T that control so much of the market that first

35:18

of all they charge ex exorbitant prices it's just extortion I mean the bills

35:24

that people pay for just basic phone data from these us companies are absurd

35:31

I mean here in China people pay a few dollars every month for significantly

35:36

more data because this is a public good the Chinese government understands that

35:42

telecommunications is a public good it's not run for profit these are state-owned companies like China Telecom and others

35:48

and they provide this as a public service for their country along with the

35:54

construction companies are largely state-owned the trans Transportation grid is largely state-owned all of the

36:00

big banks are state-owned because these are public goods they're not run by

36:05

these small handfuls of corporate oligopolies or monopolies that use it to

36:12

extract rent just rent seeking it's not actually engaged in production and helping to grow the economy productively

36:19

instead these us monopolies they simply want to extract more rent and make more

36:24

and more profits and at the end of the day actually makes the economy less productive but anyway the point is it's

Cars and computers

36:30

not just the phones that I'm that we're talking about it's also computers for instance you know what the world's

36:35

largest computer company is it's Lenovo which is a Chinese company and again

36:41

China is technologically Sovereign when it comes to computers and then cars another important example China thanks

36:49

to State planning thanks to Industrial policy CH the Chinese government decided

36:55

that they wanted to Target certain strategic IC sectors and make significant strides in car manufacturing

37:00

in particular manufacturing of electric vehicles was one of them and in just three years China has become the world's

37:08

top exporter of cars and in particular electric vehicles and if you go around

37:14

China especially in big cities like Beijing where I am you can see that there are a lot of charging stations I

37:21

mean it's incredible how much more advanced China is in terms of infrastructure than even a lot of Western countries on many street corners

37:28

you can find car charging stations not only for for cars but also for for

37:34

instance motorcycles and motorbikes and these kinds of things and these are made largely by Chinese companies like byd

37:42

which is becoming a huge producer of electric vehicles and it's going to be a name that's going to be known all around

37:48

the world by the way in terms of using those cars if you want to get a cab get a taxi the app you use is not Uber it's

37:56

not not lift now Uber is used in a lot of countries and of course Uber is yet another us Corporation but in China they

38:04

have their own version which is DD and other applications so once again this is another example of that technological

38:10

sovereignty and by the way I should point out that even a lot of the foreign firms that produce cars in China like

38:18

for instance Volkswagen they're still produced in China the supply chain is in China and what's funny is you'll see you

38:25

know Volkswagen cars that have the Volkswagen symbol but they have Chinese text written on them or BMW cars with

38:32

the Chinese text on them so again that's because China has developed these policies where they don't simply just

38:38

welcome in all foreign direct investment without any conditions they require joint Partnerships they require local

38:46

Equity Stakes I mean they have thought about industrial policy in a way that has made them more technologically

38:53

Sovereign helped them develop the supply chain at every level and now China is not simply riant on foreign corporations

39:02

to one to simply survive economically but also too to advance technologically

US sanctions and tech war

39:08

and this by the way precisely explains why us sanctions have not been

39:14

successful because the US sanctions have essentially made China even more

39:19

technologically Sovereign semiconductors are a great example of this the US government imposed sanctions on China CH

39:26

on Chinese firms and institutions trying to prevent China from developing

39:32

Advanced semiconductor technology Banning firms around the world from

39:38

exporting Advanced semiconductors Advanced chips or Quantum Computing parts or AI technology or they face the

39:45

threat of us sanctions or us secondary sanctions but what has happened this has

39:51

not worked in just a few years Huawei has made enormous technological strides

39:57

and the newest Huawei phone the mate 60 pro has 7 nanometer chips now the US

40:04

sanctions targeting Huawei and other firms were trying to prevent China from

40:10

developing chips that were 14 nanometers or smaller well China is already

40:15

developing s nanometer chips and again why is this it's because of the technological sovereignty that it has

40:22

the US imposed sanctions to try to prevent China from getting access to advance some conductor so what happened

40:27

well China has a state-owned semiconductor company which is called

40:33

smic semiconductor manufacturing international corporation and what happened the state-owned company

40:39

developed the technology and gave it to Huawei a Chinese firm and now by the way the US is claiming absurdly that China

40:47

is violating sanctions because a Chinese state-owned company smic gave technology

40:54

to a Chinese phone company huwei so China is trading with China which

40:59

violates sanctions according to the US I mean this is again this madness is exactly why China has prioritized being

41:08

technologically Sovereign why it's so important it's not only a matter of Economic Development it's a matter of

41:14

National Security now a lot of westerners will criticize the Chinese government for censoring social media

Censorship, or digital tariffs?

41:21

but in reality what when China blocks Western social media application

41:26

what you should really think about this is not censorship it's actually basically a kind of tariff what do I

41:32

mean by that well China developed its own technological Alternatives and then

41:38

by blocking the Western Silicon Valley corporations China encouraged people in

41:44

the country to use applications like WeChat webo Billy bil that doesn't mean

41:51

that it's illegal to use Western social media or when we say Western social

41:56

media we mean us social media platforms because where are the European social media platforms Europe is just as

42:02

dependent on the US for these social media companies so it's not illegal to use

42:07

YouTube in China obviously I mean I'm using it right now I mean cgtn the Chinese State media Outlet uses YouTube

42:14

it's not illegal in China to use Twitter I mean Chinese government officials use

42:19

Twitter so instead it's blocked but a lot of people use vpns it's very common

42:25

in China it's not legal it's not about censorship it's about protectionism so

42:31

this is basically a form of economic protectionism like a tariff what is the idea behind a tariff well if a country

42:38

wants to develop its own local industry it will impose tariffs on foreign

42:45

competitors in order to encourage the creation of local infant Industries So

42:51

So eventually they can get to a point where they're competitive enough in international markets and then the

42:57

government can lift those tariffs and the local industry will not be simply destroyed and cannibalized by Foreign

43:05

competition tariffs are a way that countries all around the world have used to develop local industries by the way

43:12

not just China the Western Powers all use tariffs to develop their economy the

43:18

South Korean development Economist Haj Jun Chang showed this in his book kicking away the letter they had

43:23

protectionist models in the US in multiple European economies in order to develop their own local infant

43:30

Industries and eventually when those industries were competitive enough and large enough that they wouldn't be

43:36

devoured by Foreign competitors then the government's lifted tariffs and that

43:42

prevented their local industries from being cannibalized and then those countries becoming economically

43:47

dependent on foreign firms this is exactly how the Western economies developed and yet they tell countries

43:53

all around the world to lift their tariffs to end their protectionist policies well China is actually doing

44:00

what they Rich economies did and not only in the form of tariffs which I mean

44:06

you know tariffs are hundreds of years old this is not a new idea for economic development so China applied the same

44:13

idea of a tariff but not just for the creation of tangible physical Industries

44:19

but also for digital infrastructure for social media platforms for software

44:25

applications so it's not just about censorship and control it's about China

44:30

protecting its local Industries so it can become technologically Sovereign in

44:37

a way that other countries are not now we know that the US government can clearly see how important the issue of

44:43

technological sovereignty is because there's been this hysterical Drive in the US to ban Tik Tok many US

44:50

politicians are calling to ban Tik Tok and they claim this is a matter of National Security and all of that but

44:56

it's also simply a way of preventing Chinese firms from competing with us

45:02

monopolies like meta like YouTube which is owned by Google so this is another

45:07

form of economic protectionism so the US once again is criticizing China for its

45:13

protectionist policies but the US is engaging in those very same policies it's deeply hypocritical and of course

45:19

the US Commerce Secretary Gina rundo said publicly that Washington's goal is

45:26

to prevent China from developing and innovating technologically that is an

45:31

actual quote from a top US government official we don't want China to innovate

45:37

more than we do so they don't want competition so ironically the US sanctions on China which are

45:45

increasingly aggressive targeting many different companies in China and different sectors of the economy

45:51

different Industries they ironically have the impact of basically functioning as tariff

45:56

and in the long run the medium to the long run this is actually making China even more technologically Sovereign it's

46:04

not dependent on us companies instead of depending on foreign semiconductor

46:10

technology China is developing it itself so this all gets back to the point I was saying earlier about protectionism you

46:17

know this this this Western propaganda narrative saying that the Chinese government just wants to control

46:24

everything and its totality Arian they want to censor everything no by blocking

46:29

Western social media platforms it's a form of protectionism and it's a way of

46:35

Defending its technological and economic sovereignty in a way that's been very successful in a way that no other

46:42

country on Earth has been able to replicate to such a degree that us

46:47

Silicon Valley big Tech corporations have colonized the digital and

46:53

technological space of economies in I would say the majority of the world

Problems

46:59

so when I go into all this detail about the importance of sovereignty and why I think China is the most sovereign

47:05

country on Earth this isn't to say that China is perfect obviously there are problems and for instance the Chinese

47:12

government has acknowledged that it has problems economically I can think of two really big ones right now first of all

47:18

China is still very much dependent on energy on importing energy and China is

47:25

also to to a lesser extent dependent on importing food I'll start with energy

Energy security and green transition

47:31

China does still import a lot of fossil fuels especially oil especially gas and

47:38

you know China actually is this isn't that well known it is one of the world's top 10 producers of oil and gas but

47:45

that's mostly because it's such a huge country it does not produce enough oil and gas to meet all its needs it is

47:52

heavily dependent on importing fossil fuels and that explains why China for instance has been trying to maintain

47:59

very positive relations with countries in West Asia like in the Persian Gulf region countries like Saudi Arabia and

48:06

the UAE which have historically been very close us allies but actually in the

48:11

past decade they've be China has become their top trading partner and at the same time of course China also has very

48:17

close relations with Iran another significant exporter of oil and gas of

48:23

course China and Russia have become very close allies and Russia is another major

48:29

producer of oil and gas so that is a way of maintaining its energy stability in

48:34

China and especially as it grows economically it needs more and more energy so this is not only a question of

48:41

economic stability it's simply a question of National Security but China also understands the incredible

48:47

importance of transitioning away from fossil fuels one because it is so

48:53

dependent on importing fossil fuels but also even more important because of climate change China takes the threat of

49:00

climate change very seriously much more seriously than many Western politicians especially in the US where there are

49:06

still so many US politicians who are climate science deniers I mean they have

49:11

their heads in the sand like an ostrich it's completely catastrophic considering that the US historically and still today

49:18

is the largest per capita emitter of carbon and is destroying the planet

49:24

China on the other hand is going through a revolutionary transition toward

49:29

renewable energy China alone is responsible for more than 80% of all of

49:35

the world's investment in renewable energy manufacturing China is leading

49:42

the world in the production and installation of solar panels and wind turbines in fact China already has more

49:49

photovoltaic power that is PV power capacity than the following countries

49:55

combined the United States Japan India Germany Australia Spain and South Korea

50:02

in 20122 44% of all of the new electricity capacity installed in China

50:09

was solar panel capacity and this year 2023 China is on the path to install

50:18

more solar panel capacity than the US has ever installed in its entire history

50:24

so China understands the grave threat of climate change it's taking it very

50:29

seriously it is leading the world in the green transition and this also is a matter of national security for China

50:36

and and once again it makes it more Sovereign so it's not so dependent on foreign energy now another weakness in

Food security

50:44

China is the issue of food sovereignty and Beijing has understood the Supreme

50:50

importance of food sovereignty and in recent decades the Chinese government has invested invested huge sums of money

50:57

in increasing the capacity of local food production as the food and agriculture

51:02

organization of the United Nations pointed out quote China has succeeded in

51:07

producing 1/4 of the world's grain and feeding 1 of the world's population with

51:14

less than 10% of the world's arable land which is a great achievement in pursuit

51:19

of food and nutrition security not only in China but also in the world currently

51:25

China ranks first in the world in terms of the production of cereals cotton

51:31

fruit vegetables meat poultry eggs and fishery products however that said China

51:38

is still the world's largest food importer I mean again it's feeding 1.4

51:44

billion people so that's a lot of malice to feed but that is another weakness in

51:49

terms of its potential National Security and China has been trying to increase its food s sovereignty I actually

51:56

published an article about this over at geopolitical economy.com looking at

52:02

China's state-funded agricultural Cooperative program and how it's using co-ops to try to increase agricultural

52:09

production and strengthen food security for people who are interested in that I will link to that article in the

52:14

description below but the point I'm getting at here is that China recognizes that there are weaknesses and it's

Debt

52:21

trying to strengthen its sovereignty even more in some of these key areas especially now as it's in a moment of

52:28

economic transition and you've probably seen there has been a lot of hyperbolic reporting in the western media claiming

52:35

that the Chinese economic model is in a crisis and China is going to collapse

52:40

and all of that nonsense I mean this is the same kind of propaganda we've heard for decades with so-called China experts

52:47

in the west like Gordon Chang who have claimed for decades for 20 years now that China is on the verge of collapsing

52:55

obviously that's not true it's ridiculous but there are some problems in China and economists in China are

53:01

working on solving these issues like for instance there is a growing problem of debt in debted especially for local

53:09

governments although I should point out that this is debt that one is owed

53:14

largely to state-owned banks in China it's not like the banks in the United States which are all private for-profit

53:21

commercial banks in China the biggest banks are all state-owned and they are

53:26

run in National interest the interest of people and if they really needed to write down a lot of this debt they could

53:33

and furthermore this debt this government debt is owed in Reni in the

53:38

Chinese Yuan it's not owed in dollars it's not owed in a foreign currency so it's much easier for China to deal with

53:45

this issue of rising debt than for instance a country like Argentina or Egypt which is trapped in debt that is

53:53

owed in dollars in a foreign currency and the Argentine Central Bank can't print dollars the Egyptian Central Bank

54:00

the Central Bank of Ghana or Sri Lanka they can't print dollars in order to pay

54:05

off this foreign currency denominated debt so yes there are some problems that

54:12

economists in China are trying to Grapple with but they are actually dealing with these issues another big

Inequality

54:19

issue that people talk about a lot and it's something that you can physically see is inequality they absolutely is

54:26

inequality in China and the Chinese government has prioritized the fight against inequality well first the

54:33

Chinese government's goal was to lift hundreds of millions of people out of extreme poverty and the Chinese

54:39

government did succeed in helping to lift more than 800 million people out of

54:44

extreme poverty ending extreme poverty in the country so now the Communist

54:50

Party of China has emphasized that its new primary goal is combating inequality

54:57

and at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2017 the party officially changed its

55:05

policy saying that previously its top priority was developing the productive

55:11

forces of the Chinese economy expanding its manufacturing capabilities expanding

55:17

infrastructure development and now as of 2017 its top priority is fighting any

55:25

equality and uneven development within China and encouraging what the Chinese

55:30

government refers to as common Prosperity so now that absolute poverty has been ended now that the

55:36

infrastructure is incredible now the goal is to make sure that Chinese

55:42

working people have much better standards of living and there is better equality between them these are all

Democracy?

55:49

things that governments should do for their people and yet many Western governments after decades of the

55:55

neoliberal capitalist model are captive they're controlled by wealthy oligarchs

56:01

by large corporations and financial interests they fund politicians and make

56:07

sure that politicians win elections especially in the US where bribery is essentially legal because the Supreme

56:13

Court and citizens united said that political contributions donations are free speech so rich people can basically

56:20

buy elections and more than 90% of the candidates running for congress who have more funding win the elections meanwhile

56:28

lobbying which is considered corruption in most countries is completely legal in

56:34

these Western governments especially in Washington so again you have a government that is completely controlled

56:41

by large corporations by the rich by the 1% this is why it's not surprising that

56:47

a majority of Chinese people when they're actually surveyed say they consider their government to be

56:52

Democratic it's not the same kind of democracy in the western capitalist countries which is really a

56:59

plutocracy but it is a different kind of democracy which the Chinese government refers to as whole process people's

57:06

democracy and it's why ironically a western government-backed organization

57:12

closely linked to Nato which is called The Alliance of democracies carried out

57:17

a poll in 2022 called the Democracy perception index and it found that 83 %

57:25

of people in China consider their government to be a democracy and by the way 77% of people in Vietnam consider

57:32

their government to be a democracy compared to the US where only 49% of

57:38

people consider their government to be a democracy so less than half the population and in France even fewer 47%

57:45

of people consider their government to be Democratic if you think about all the things that I've discussed today about

57:51

sovereignty about defending the national interest and doing what best for the actual people the working people of the

57:57

country and not big corporations and foreign corporations you can see why these results make sense by the way if

58:04

you also see how safe China is it makes sense I mean this is the safest country

58:09

I've ever been in it's incredible people go out and party and drink at night and you know young women can walk home at

58:16

3:00 a.m. completely safe they're not they're not worried at all I've heard from women here who say that they're so

58:22

grateful because they've traveled to other count countries and they have not felt the sense of security I mean these

58:28

are intangible things that aren't included in GDP measurements but they're extremely important to understand the

58:35

quality of life in countries like China that are so demonized by the west and

58:40

it's very important to understand that and that's what I'm trying to do by living here in China studying China

58:47

learning more about China and trying to communicate that to largely Western audiences because of course the

58:53

mainstream corporate media is not going to do it unfortunately they've shown again and again and again that they're simply going to collaborate

59:00

with Western governments they're not going to bite the hand that feeds them their scoops and they're going to continue to manufacture consent for more

59:08

and more aggressive policies against China in this new Cold War now there's

Protecting sovereignty is not isolationism

59:14

one other important point that I want to stress here before I conclude and that is that we should not confuse China's

59:22

sovereignty with isolation China does not want to close itself off

59:28

to the rest of the world and in fact if you listen to the speeches of Chinese government officials and if you look at

59:35

government policy Economic Policy you can see that China is still very much interested in international trade I mean

59:41

especially considering that yes China is Sovereign in all these ways but China also maintains a chronic current account

59:49

Surplus it has a trade surplus with the rest of the world exporting significantly more more than it Imports

Export- or consumption-based model?

59:55

in fact this issue has led to a big debate about the future of the Chinese economy there are economists who say

1:00:03

that China should stop emphasizing the importance of exports and transition its

1:00:08

model more toward internal consumption increasing local demand and have more of

1:00:14

a service sector-based economy and there are indications that China will will

1:00:19

probably move in that direction somewhat although Chinese officials are very

1:00:25

concerned they don't want to get stuck in the infamous middle inome trap they don't want to repeat the mistakes of

1:00:32

Japan and get trapped in decades of economic stagnation they still want to

1:00:38

make sure that production is the basis of their economy they don't want to financialized like the Western

1:00:45

neoliberal economies they don't want to de-industrialized those same problems so

1:00:50

this is why Chinese officials have been hesitant about adopting the advice of economists who say that instead it

1:00:57

should prioritize boosting local demand local consumption it's in a complicated

1:01:02

situation because by keeping the Yuan undervalued it makes Chinese exports

1:01:09

much more competitive but at the same time that also it reduces local demand

1:01:15

so if it wants to have a more consumer oriented economy it will likely have to increase the value of thean which could

1:01:23

potentially lead to more and more Imports which could reduce China's Trade Surplus with the rest of the world but

1:01:29

then exports would become less competitive because its currency would become more and more valued so China

1:01:35

doesn't want to destroy its industrial sector its production this issue has led

1:01:40

to a big debate about the future of the Chinese economy there are a lot of

1:01:46

economists who argue that the Chinese rimi the currency the iwan the iwan is the unit of account the rimi is the

1:01:52

official name that it's very undervalued and I think actually it's true the

1:01:58

currency is very much undervalued because things are very cheap here in

1:02:03

China if you have access to a foreign currency like dollars for instance and a lot of that is because so much is

1:02:09

produced domestically food is very cheap even technology technological products

1:02:14

are very cheap because they're produced here you don't have to pay extra for the cost of transportation for imports

1:02:20

because it's all produced in the country this means that basically everything in China is extremely cheap except for

1:02:27

imported goods and real estate real estate is still very expensive but by

1:02:32

the way that's why the government has bursted the bubble the real estate bubble this is an important point to

1:02:39

stress there's a lot of reporting in the western media very hyperbolic reporting claiming that the Chinese real estate

1:02:46

sector is collapsing and this is going to cause the economy to collapse what they don't point out is that this is partially intentional government policy

1:02:53

Beijing made the intentional decision not to bail out big real estate giants

1:02:59

like evergrand which probably would have been bailed out in you know the Western neoliberal countries instead president

1:03:06

XI said housing Is For Living in it's not for speculation around 90% of people

1:03:12

in China own the houses that they live in and by the way this is one of the highest rates in the world and you know

1:03:19

other countries that have some of the highest rates of home home ownership in the entire world Vietnam Cuba laoo other

1:03:27

countries that have socialist governments they have encouraged a policy in which almost everyone owns the

1:03:33

houses that they live in the Chinese government did not want so much of its economy to be based on speculation in

1:03:40

this big real estate bubble like the Western neoliberal economies like the US economy which is based on financial

1:03:47

speculation by bursting this bubble intentionally this is the Chinese government saying that they're moving

1:03:53

toward slowly transitioning toward a new economic model that's not interested in

1:03:59

this form of you know real estate speculation this bubble instead it's looking toward sectors like Advanced

1:04:06

industrial production in high technology high tech sectors like for instance

1:04:12

renewable energy like semiconductors and phones and computers and electric

1:04:19

vehicles China has become the world's largest car manufacturer exporting more

1:04:24

cars even than Japan and Germany which had been the world's you know car

1:04:30

superpowers China is becoming a new high-tech superpower it's no longer

1:04:35

producing the very low value added technological products that that China

1:04:42

was known for for many decades I mean when I was growing up you know in the 1990s there were all these stereotypes

1:04:47

about China and these products being made in China which meant you know they were bad quality products they were very

1:04:53

you know cheap little toys and stuff I mean today China is at The Cutting Edge of technological production and the

1:05:00

Chinese government can see very clearly that is the future of its economy but with all of that said this leads me back

Comparative advantage: a critique

1:05:06

to the issue of trade I want to stress that China is not interested in

1:05:11

isolationism it's not trying to block itself off from the rest of the world China still very much is interested in

1:05:19

international trade but I think this gets back to a fundamental flaw in the

1:05:24

way that many economists around the world think about international trade and this goes back to the idea of

1:05:30

comparative advantage which was developed by the political Economist David Ricardo back in the early 19th

1:05:37

century if you take a macroeconomics 101 class you will learn about comparative

1:05:42

advantage and you know there is an element of Truth in it of course and it essentially says that countries should

1:05:50

not prioritize economic production in sectors where they could instead invest those

1:05:57

resources and that energy and labor and capital in higher value added Industries

1:06:03

so as a very basic example if in your country you have a lot of people trained

1:06:08

as Engineers you have invested a lot in human capital you should instead you should create computers and phones and

1:06:15

cars and they should those Engineers should not be you know sewing cloth to make clothes right the classical example

1:06:23

that David Ricardo used back in the early 19th century was with England and Portugal with the production of cloth

1:06:31

and wine and the argument was that Portugal had a an absolute advantage in

1:06:37

producing both wine and cloth that is to say it could produce more wine and cloth

1:06:43

than England but it would be in Portugal's comparative advantage to

1:06:48

instead produce wine and England should instead produce cloth because England

1:06:54

had a comparative advantage in producing cloth and David Ricardo being a classical political Economist he saw all

1:07:02

value as coming from labor and of course the neoclassical economists who came you

1:07:07

know several decades later would would turn this all in its head instead they said that value comes from essentially

1:07:12

pleasure from utility which is much harder to measure right but David Ricardo is measuring things in terms of

1:07:19

the amount of hours of Labor that are needed in order to produce these products and he said that you know it

1:07:25

makes sense if Portugal and England trade they will become wealthier and more prosperous if Portugal instead

1:07:33

produces according to its comparative advantage and produces wine and Britain

1:07:38

England produces according to its comparative advantage and produces cloth and then they trade with each other now

1:07:44

this argument is true and of course comparative advantage can be very important however there are several ma

1:07:51

major problems with David Ricardo conception of comparative advantage first of all it assumes that Capital

1:07:58

cannot move and labor cannot move between these countries and we can see in the era of Outsourcing in particular

1:08:04

and with new technologies capital is very easy to move in fact Capital moves

1:08:10

more easily than human beings in many cases but even it's also easier for

1:08:15

human beings to move with new technologies despite you know restrictions on immigration and all of that another problem with this idea

1:08:22

which with which is a problem with many of these thought experiments in economics is which they assume perfect

1:08:28

competition and the reality is that we have you know a world with these big corporate monopolies and oligopolies you

1:08:35

know like Monsanto and big Tech corporations and all of that on Silicon Valley so I mean there very much is not

1:08:42

perfect competition and many of these firms are interested in destroying any competition they have around the world

1:08:48

you can see this with the way you know that Uber used the low interest rates in the US and and very cheap loans and

1:08:55

basically Uber never really made any money but it became a monopoly by eating up all of the market share by offering

1:09:03

taxis that were cheaper than all of the local taxis so they put all of the local taxis out of business and then when Uber

1:09:10

established a monopoly it hiked up prices so that's the The Profit model of

1:09:15

many of these companies they rely on low interest rates quantitative easing this big bubble all this liquidity and they

1:09:23

get really cheap loans they're not profitable this is what Amazon did as well they destroy all of their competition and then when they're the

1:09:30

Monopoly power they establish Monopoly rent and it's all about rent extraction

1:09:35

once again so the actual political economy of the world today is completely different from what David Ricardo was

1:09:41

talking about in the early 19th century furthermore this idea of comparative advantage this model assumes that the

1:09:48

different states are completely Sovereign and that they can have actually fair trade agreements between

1:09:54

them whereas you know we have colonialism and neocolonialism and imperialism and frequently what we see

1:10:00

is that the wealthy countries with big economies impose unfair trade agreements

1:10:06

on poor countries and developing countries so even the whole idea of comparative advantage is not really that

1:10:11

relevant because we're not talking about rational perfectly competitive economies

1:10:17

we're talking about unequal trade agreements imposed by these monopolized

1:10:22

and olop Iz Industries then there's the critique that comes from the Indian

1:10:28

economists praa pnik and UT pnik who pointed out that even this classical

1:10:34

example of Portugal producing wine and cloth and England producing wine and cloth it assumes that England can

1:10:41

produce wine or that these that these countries can produce the same Commodities that are produced in the

1:10:46

global South as the Pikes have pointed out if you go to the tropical climates

1:10:52

there are often har harvests two or three times a year whereas in the temperate climates in Europe there are

1:10:58

harvests only one time a year so they simply cannot produce things like how are you going to grow bananas in England

1:11:04

good luck growing mangoes in England so even this whole idea is of course it

1:11:10

breaks down as well and their analysis is much deeper their analysis is is about how imperialism is about

1:11:16

depressing the wages of workers in the global South that produce these Commodities and that's that's a point

1:11:22

I'm going to come back to in a second cuz that's fundamentally getting at my significant critique my main critique of

1:11:28

the ricardian idea of comparative advantage but there's another significant critique which is the idea

1:11:34

of National Security now of course if you're talking about things like wine and cloth okay it's not that important

1:11:39

you you don't need wine to survive if a country blocks you from importing their wine okay whatever you might some wine

1:11:46

NOS might be angry but your economy is still going to be fine but if we're talking about comparative advantage with

1:11:52

things like the production of food with things like the production of energy with things like the production of

1:11:58

certain Electronics like semiconductors that you need to power your economy then it's not simply a matter of comparative

1:12:05

advantage and what makes you more prosperous and wealthier I mean another clear example is that according to

1:12:12

classical comparative advantage Theory it does not make sense for the US to be

1:12:18

one of the world's largest agricultural exporters it would be in the US comparative advantage to focus on other

1:12:24

Industries like technological production and yet every single year the US exports

1:12:31

hundreds of billions of dollars of agricultural products because Washington

1:12:37

recognizes one that it needs food security this is a national security issue not just a question of maximizing

1:12:44

utility and and wealth but furthermore because the US government also spends many billions of dollars subsidizing

1:12:51

agriculture subsidizing these big a corporations these monopolies and oligopolies that dominate the industry

1:12:58

and then they use food exports as a political weapon to make other countries

1:13:04

like Haiti for instance dependent on us food exports after destroying local

1:13:11

agricultural capacity in poor countries like Haiti so again just looking at

1:13:16

everything in terms of comparative advantage ignores many other significant factors if you're Venezuela for instance

1:13:24

it was in your comparative advantage to Simply produce oil and Export that oil

1:13:30

to the United States and then import food and Technology from the United States that's what Venezuela did for a

1:13:36

hundred years but what happened the people of Venezuela elected a socialist

1:13:41

who nationalized the oil reserves and used that oil wealth to benefit the people of Venezuela and the US didn't

1:13:47

like that government and US corporations like Exon Mobile wanted to get access to Venezuela they had been kicked out out

1:13:53

of Venezuela their Investments had been nationalized by the Venezuelan government so what happened the US

1:13:59

imposed sanctions on Venezuela and a blockade on Venezuela and prevented V

1:14:04

Venezuela from being able to export its oil which starved the government of Revenue the government lost 99% of its

1:14:10

Revenue it couldn't export its oil it couldn't invest in further oil production it couldn't even keep up oil

1:14:16

production at a constant level because it couldn't import the technology the technological products it needed the

1:14:22

capital Goods that it needed to maintain its oil production so you saw economic

1:14:28

crisis so it was in Venezuela's comparative advantage to Simply become

1:14:34

dependent on importing food and technology so this is the other

1:14:40

fundamental problem with comparative advantage it doesn't consider the issue

1:14:45

of dependency it traps countries in cycles of dependency it says it's in the

1:14:51

comparative advantage of of the United States to export Jets jet engines and

1:14:58

weapons and missiles and TVs and computers actually those aren't even

1:15:04

produced in the US anymore but the idea is okay well it's in the US comparative advantage to export these high value

1:15:10

added technological products and it's in the comparative advantage of Honduras to keep exporting t-shirts and basic low

1:15:19

value added textile products to the US well how is Honduras going to develop

1:15:25

its technological capabilities if it just simply always acts in its comparative advantage how is bivia going

1:15:32

to develop its own local industry if all it does is export raw unprocessed

1:15:38

lithium how are Chile and Peru going to develop their local industry if they

1:15:44

simply rely on exporting raw unprocessed copper copper ore I mean this idea that

1:15:51

it's in their comparative advantage to to forever be Colonial appendages of the

1:15:58

colonial Powers so the colonial Powers export high value added products and the

1:16:04

colonized countries that are supposedly independent you know politically but economically there's this neocolonial

1:16:10

cycle of dependency if if it's in their comparative advantage to only be resource extraction hubs how are they

1:16:17

ever going to get out of this cycle of neocolonial dependency they have to be able to develop their own local industry

1:16:25

that requires protectionist policies that requires investment in their own

1:16:30

local Industries where they may not have a comparative advantage now but they could potentially have a comparative

1:16:36

advantage in the future if they can build up their infant Industries through

1:16:42

tariffs through State subsidies through investment in infrastructure and

1:16:47

research and development these are all the things that China did now if China had simply listened all of the

1:16:53

neoliberal economists and who told them it China it's in your comparative

1:16:59

advantage to Simply only produce toys for McDonald's Happy Meals and only

1:17:04

produce t-shirts and only produce cheap low value added Technologies then China

1:17:11

never would have become the high value added technological exporter that it is now so at every level at every stage

1:17:20

these policies that China has carried out of protecting its economy protecting its its technological sectors these are

1:17:28

all policies that China has used to to become more Sovereign so that now it is

1:17:34

in China's comparative advantage to produce many of these products and it's no longer in China's comparative

1:17:40

advantage to instead waste the human capital that it's developed on producing

1:17:46

textiles when they can when these Engineers can make Huawei funds so China

1:17:51

has been able to get out of this trap that so many formerly colonized poor

1:17:56

countries are stuck in and that's exactly what I'm interested in studying and learning more about and Reporting on

1:18:04

here at geopolitical economy report policies like for instance the Chinese

1:18:09

government required foreign firms that were investing in China to have joint Partnerships with local firms and to

1:18:17

have local Equity ownership China also for instance required technology

1:18:23

transfer and this is frequently referred to in the west as so-called forced technology transfer but as legal

1:18:30

scholars in the west have pointed out this is not forced technology transfer the foreign companies that invested in

1:18:36

China wanting to get access to cheap Chinese labor getting access to the highly skilled Chinese workers getting

1:18:43

access to all these parts of the supply chain located in China all of the

1:18:48

resources and that that make it easier and cheaper for products to to be

1:18:53

produced all in China the companies that invested the foreign firms that invested in China they knew that one of the

1:19:00

conditions of their investment was they had to share technology they had to partner with local firms they did so

1:19:06

voluntarily so it's not forced its voluntary technology transfer and China

1:19:12

used these policies to move up the supply chain of production and now China

1:19:18

is at the highest levels of industrial production and China is responsible for

1:19:23

nearly onethird of global manufacturing production compared to 15% for the

1:19:29

US so these are all things that I'm going to be exploring more in the future

Outro

1:19:35

here at geopolitical economy report I wanted to talk about them today because I wanted to reflect in my experience

1:19:42

living in China but also researching China a lot now I'm not an expert on

1:19:48

China I'm trying to learn much more and as I learn I'm going to share my knowledge more and more with all of you

1:19:55

I don't speak fluent Chinese so there is a language barrier I'm trying to learn more Chinese but it's very difficult but

1:20:01

this is why I'm here of course today this was very very long I think this is

1:20:06

probably my longest video but I wanted to reflect on the things that I've been thinking about a lot here as I've been

1:20:13

living in China I'm going to be thinking about them a lot more researching them a lot more doing more and Reporting on

1:20:19

them in the future why do I think this is all so important well I think there's so much that we can

1:20:25

learn from China and its unique economic model now of course there are a lot of

1:20:30

differences of course that cannot be applied in other countries like for instance the fact that China has 1.4

1:20:36

billion people it is such a massive country that gives it some advantages that other countries can't have but

1:20:43

equally I should point out it also gives China some disadvantages so the point is

1:20:48

that I think there are a lot of lessons that we can take from learning about China

1:20:53

lessons especially for a lot of developing countries in the global South but even lessons for the rich

1:20:59

industrialized countries in the west so I am going to wrap up here I want to thank everyone man if you join me to the

1:21:07

end here you really are a trooper I want to thank you for listening the entire way through and I want to remind

1:22:00

are again are totally independent I'm an independent journalist I'm living in China yes but I am doing my own work I'm

1:22:07

not being told what to do I'm not being told what to think I want to thank everyone who has supported our work here

1:22:13

at geopolitical economy report as I said at the beginning I'm not changing the

1:22:19

direction of this channel not all of my videos in the future are going to be about China and all of this I mean this

1:22:25

is going to be an of course an important point of my work but I'm going to continue discussing geopolitics

1:22:32

economics Latin America Africa Europe the US I mean other parts of Asia this

1:22:39

is not just all going to be a China focused Channel but of course China plays such an important role in the

1:22:45

rapidly evolving geopolitical and economic order so of course it's going to be a big part of my reporting and

1:22:52

Analysis here so with that said I really am going to conclude here I want to thank everyone once again for joining me

1:23:00

and I'll see you next time
