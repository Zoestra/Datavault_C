Can someone please explain to me why we are all so afraid of China? Like, someone please explain this to me because I'm just living off of this kind of ethereal understanding that this is a country that we should be concerned about, but I haven't actually found any reason, especially after getting to know the people of China. Like, why are we so concerned about this? Like, what? Please, like, somebody spell this out for me.

00:28
What is the threat? I don't understand because it seems like there's just this kind of like action spy level movie kind of idea of what might happen if we form some kind of like deep alliance with this country or we allow them to.

00:47
know us? I don't, I don't, someone explain this to me. Like all of their niceties and kindness is all like an ulterior motive and it's all spyware and malware and they want all of our data. What are they gonna do with it? Advertise to me? Tell me that I need a toaster? I fucking know, okay? And by the way, who else doesn't have this data? I'm so confused about the data. Someone explain the data to me.

01:14
And I know I sound ignorant and I'm okay with that because I know that I also represent probably 95% of Americans that are just kind of like going with it or have been going with it because we think, oh, this is the right thing. We need to be wary. We need to be careful. But why?

01:32
Like why? Because if you talk to them, they're like super benevolent. And if anything, they're just kind of concerned. They're like, are you okay? Are you all okay? Because we're doing great over here. Like we are thriving at all income levels. They don't have homelessness. That's not a thing for them. They don't have drug problems. They don't have substance abuse. They have healthcare. They have...

01:56
free healthcare. They don't even pay property taxes. They have like no property taxes. I've been watching videos on Zao Hong Xu where you can go to an open-air market and afford groceries at the lowest possible income level for $10 a week.

02:11
So we might even think about like, oh, made in China, we're thinking about these like sweat shops or like the absolute worst possible conditions that they could be making all the shit that we buy. But still, those people working in those factories, doing those jobs that you're imagining, are having a better life and being taken care of better by their government than you are working a nine to five, busting your ass to pay for your private insurance, your fucking rent, and an overpay for inflation groceries at your grocery store. And by the way, there's like a homeless guy

02:41
you're kind of like, what the fuck happened to him? And it's like, oh, like everything just like, ugh. Like, so seriously, someone explain this to me because I want to know, like make me a believer. Why should I be afraid of this country?
