"If you have enough food and clothing, you will know the etiquette; if you have enough food and clothing, you will know the honor and disgrace." This proverb comes from " Guanzi Herdsmen ", which means that only when people have sufficient granaries and sufficient food and clothing can they take into account etiquette and pay attention to honor and shame.
This sentence actually talks about human nature. Only when people are rich can they improve their pursuits. The reverse is also true. If people's food and clothing problems cannot be solved, they will not be able to persist for long even if they have noble moral values ...


One cannot concern oneself with honor and disgrace unless they have enough food and clothing


Economic rights precedes human rights.
