Tiananmen square and other goodies Good reporting on the NED from a conservative outlet. [https://www.theamericanconservative.com/the-national-endowment-for-political-meddling-democracy-ned/](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/the-national-endowment-for-political-meddling-democracy-ned/ "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/the-national-endowment-for-political-meddling-democracy-ned/") This next small article is one you can find video footage of. The second paragraph is used often to demonstrate the radical intellectual's duplicity in leading the student protests, knowing that to achieve their goals ppl need to die. However she's not alone in this among revolutionaries or counter revolutionaries. You can make of it what you will.

I think it must be an actual old news clipping. [https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1BcfxpzK9Oy7oT9TCkJMEA6GaKcTOKu-FhCABj4TsidM/pub?pli=1](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1BcfxpzK9Oy7oT9TCkJMEA6GaKcTOKu-FhCABj4TsidM/pub?pli=1 "https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1BcfxpzK9Oy7oT9TCkJMEA6GaKcTOKu-FhCABj4TsidM/pub?pli=1") I feel this is a very fair report though not as thorough as I've seen. It's an alternative narrative anyway. To add on to the color revolution claim, we know they did this because of the first article about the NED and what ppl like Soros admits to. Calling easterner Europe the, "Soros empire" also alleges that the protests were about corruption and not democracy but there's probably overlap.

Reading about this again I'm reminded about all the conflicting reports. Here's the value of this article to the heterodox narrative. The students were violent enough to wrestle arms from soldiers and to beat unarmed/soldiers unwilling to fire. There may have been orders to not be violent initially and it seems where it could be helped this was avoided. The students are said to be pro freedom and democracy, which is positioned as the opposite to Communism. However the students sing the international so, clearly not anti communist. The death count here is 2600 at the top. At the bottom is says 21 civilians are laid out in a makeshift morgue. So is that meant to say that the majority of deaths were of soldiers, or maybe the first figure didn't have details? [http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/06/04/wsj-archives-25-years-ago-in-beijing-a-movement-unlikely-to-die/](http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/06/04/wsj-archives-25-years-ago-in-beijing-a-movement-unlikely-to-die/ "http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/06/04/wsj-archives-25-years-ago-in-beijing-a-movement-unlikely-to-die/") A correction article by the times, it contradicts certain statements in the previous article about the violence of the army against the students near the Central monument. Confirms that shootings happened elsewhere and that the report of dramatic violent repression at the moment are from an unreliable source. [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/13/world/turmoil-china-tiananmen-crackdown-student-s-account-questioned-major-points.html](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/13/world/turmoil-china-tiananmen-crackdown-student-s-account-questioned-major-points.html "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/13/world/turmoil-china-tiananmen-crackdown-student-s-account-questioned-major-points.html") BBC disputing the claim that a massacre occurred in the square. A biased person like me is given to thinking those killed in Beijing were a mix of students egged on my radicals, maybe with arms, unrestrained /frustrated and amateurish soldiers and confusion. Personally I seriously doubt the idea that it was ordered top down to massacre the rebels. Clearly a lot of care was put into the square bc of it's flash point for the moment and it's symbology to the Chinese ppl. It's possible that a more hands off approach occurred in areas bound to be less concentrated with the media. But I'm a dirty commie so I'm interested in your opinion.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8057762.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8057762.stm "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8057762.stm") Richard Roth of CBS corroborates The PRC's version of events at the square, and the above article. Still confirming that many ppl died around tiananmen, but he admitted to nodding along with his colleagues and choosing not to contradict them. What's the evidence for his final claim then? That a lot of ppl agree? A lot agree about tiananmen as well, but clearly it's not the only narrative. Just the most popular one for obvious reasons. [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/there-was-no-tiananmen-square-massacre/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/there-was-no-tiananmen-square-massacre/ "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/there-was-no-tiananmen-square-massacre/") This is not my finest work. I say that because there are two other amazing articles on this with photos and great sourcing. So I tried to look more up. I think it's indicative that the first things I see confirm the mainstream narrative, including the following article written just this year. Figured I'd include it for fairness and as a juxtaposition. [https://www.amnesty.org.uk/china-1989-tiananmen-square-protests-demonstration-massacre](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/china-1989-tiananmen-square-protests-demonstration-massacre "https://www.amnesty.org.uk/china-1989-tiananmen-square-protests-demonstration-massacre") This article, but the Party for Socialism and Liberation's press wing is a great summation and I love it. You can see the bias especially after you've read the above sources. Nonetheless you could start here and then work to the others if you would like a summary and further explanation. [https://www.liberationnews.org/revolution-and-counter-revolution-remembering-tiananmen-34-years-later/](https://www.liberationnews.org/revolution-and-counter-revolution-remembering-tiananmen-34-years-later/ "https://www.liberationnews.org/revolution-and-counter-revolution-remembering-tiananmen-34-years-later/")

There is so much I want to say about all this. To save you pain I won't but it'd be cool to get your opinion and talk about it if you're ever interested. My brain is swiss cheese more and more each day so I'm sorry that I remember things wrong, like how I described the cause of the protest at the bar, tho I believe that description to carry some weight still. I'll be honest, I'm burned out cuz I've been at it for 3 hours. I need to substantiate what I said tho so here. I FINALLY found an article I read a while back that has the picture of the burned and hung PLA solider and a Chinese protester with a rifle. Yeah one. Sorry if I mischaracterized. I only skimmed for the picture so I haven't read this one tonight. [https://worldaffairs.blog/2019/06/02/tiananmen-square-massacre-facts-fiction-and-propaganda/](https://worldaffairs.blog/2019/06/02/tiananmen-square-massacre-facts-fiction-and-propaganda/ "https://worldaffairs.blog/2019/06/02/tiananmen-square-massacre-facts-fiction-and-propaganda/") There's one thing I'm sorry to say I can't source rn but I know it exists. The award winning documentary maker who may have had a hand in the actions in Beijing. The article I bookmarked that I suspect linked to it, is now no longer accessible for some reason.
