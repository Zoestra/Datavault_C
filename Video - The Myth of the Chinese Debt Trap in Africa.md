In the past two decades,

0:04

China has built large infrastructure projects

0:06

in almost every country in Africa.

0:09

And this has made Western critics uncomfortable.

0:12

China and Africa can forge an even stronger,

0:16

comprehensive, strategic and cooperative partnership.

0:19

A common portrayal of China's lending practices

0:22

is known as debt-trap diplomacy,

0:24

a phrase made popular after being used

0:26

in government documents during the Trump administration.

0:30

The so-called debt-trap is created when a country

0:32

lends to poorer countries,

0:34

intentionally overwhelming them with unsustainable debt,

0:37

forcing them to surrender strategic assets

0:39

or concede increased political leverage.

0:42

But so far, there's no evidence that such a debt-trap

0:45

has been sprung in Africa.

0:47

Now there's always a certain grain of truth,

0:49

like with every stereotype to it.

0:51

But it breaks down very, very quickly

0:54

upon any type of serious examination.

0:58

The focus on debt-trap diplomacy

1:00

is part of wider Western anxieties towards China in Africa.

1:05

We've already seen that Chinese investments

1:08

and Chinese infrastructure projects

1:09

have been linked to increasing Chinese influence

1:11

within the host country ruling elite.

1:13

That may end up becoming somewhat of a leverage point

1:16

for China to push some of these countries or ruling elites

1:18

to side with China on critical issues

1:20

that are important to the U.S. or to its allies.

1:24

But while the U.S. has focused its Africa strategy

1:27

on aid and social services, China has been building.

1:31

African governments themselves said,

1:32

"We are tired of aid and charity, we want to do trade,

1:36

we want to be treated like partners."

1:38

The Chinese came along and said, "Great.

1:40

"we don't do aid and charity,

1:41

we wanna do business with you."

1:43

Global Gateway will mobilize â‚¬300 billion till 2027.

1:49

Now the U.S. and Europe are answering back

1:51

with their own infrastructure initiatives to counter China,

1:54

but African experts are skeptical.

1:57

At the end of the day, China has been

1:59

that guy around the corner with a bouquet of flowers.

2:05

To Africa, the U.S., Europe and the U.K.,

2:09

have time and time again said,

2:11

"Be careful of the flowers you see out of the window,

2:13

they have thorns on them."

2:23

In Ghana the handover of power from the British government

2:26

went off smoothly and with dignity.

2:29

From the 1950s into the 1970s,

2:32

countries on the African continent

2:34

gained independence from their European colonizers.

2:38

U.S. and European-led organizations

2:40

like the IMF and the World Bank,

2:42

funded much needed infrastructure across the continent.

2:46

But that slowly stopped.

2:49

The United States and Europe kinda backed away

2:51

from infrastructure in the 60s and 70s.

2:54

It's something that we did very, very well

2:56

for a long time in the postwar era,

2:58

we built vast amounts of infrastructure

2:59

throughout the world.

3:01

And one of the things you see in Africa,

3:03

is that so much of the railways and the highways

3:05

and the infrastructure was built during the colonial period.

3:08

And back then it was quite solid.

3:10

But it's been decrepit

3:11

because the former colonial governments

3:13

are not plowing in lots of money.

3:16

Enter China. As early as the 1970s,

3:19

Beijing began building the Tazara Railway,

3:22

a link between the Zambian town of Kapiri Mposhi

3:25

and Dar es Salaam port in Tanzania.

3:28

At the time it was the longest railway

3:30

in Sub-Saharan Africa, allowing Zambia to ship copper,

3:34

bypassing white-ruled Rhodesia and South Africa.

3:37

It also gave China much needed political allies.

3:41

Beijing said, "We have problems, you have problems,

3:45

we will help you out."

3:46

And they embarked on this.

3:48

And this is really some of the early seeds

3:52

that China sowed in Africa that later

3:56

came to clearly define the divide

4:00

between the West and the East,

4:03

as far as China's involvement in Africa is concerned.

4:07

In the early 2000s, as China looked to expand markets

4:10

and political influence abroad,

4:12

its investment in Africa ramped up.

4:16

The Chinese said, "Well, guess what?

4:17

We are the best in the world now

4:19

at producing large scale infrastructure, fast and cheap.

4:23

And we have a surplus of capital,

4:25

so we'll loan you the money,

4:26

we have our great contracting companies.

4:28

We have all of this skill and all this ability

4:30

to deliver fast and cheap."

4:32

And in that sense, it was really an ideal match.

4:35

They recognized what Africa's development stage was.

4:39

And they said, "You know what?

4:40

30 years ago, that was us.

4:44

We recognize a lot of what's going on here.

4:46

You don't have enough infrastructure,

4:48

you have a large population that's growing quickly."

4:51

Also let's not underestimate there is a shared history here

4:55

of anti-colonial struggle.

4:57

So you tick all of those different boxes,

4:59

and Africa made a lot of sense for the Chinese to come in.

5:03

China is currently involved

5:05

in an estimated 35 African countries,

5:07

and has made significant contributions

5:09

to their infrastructure, including ports, railways

5:13

and power plants.

5:15

It's estimated that China has invested

5:18

more than $340 billion in Africa.

5:21

So compared to how much China is investing across the world,

5:25

this may not be as much.

5:27

But for Africa, it's a lot of money

5:29

because of the huge infrastructure gap that Africa faces.

5:34

But there are noticeable differences

5:36

between Chinese financing and how the West lends

5:39

historically with low interest rates and flexible terms.

5:43

There must be over millions

5:45

of different types of loans out there.

5:47

But if you were to take an eagle's-eye view

5:50

of the different kinds of loans involving Chinese lenders,

5:53

then you can broadly categorize them

5:56

into three different types.

5:58

The loans fall into three categories.

6:01

Zero interest loans offered as aid,

6:03

concession loans which have a lower interest rate,

6:06

often intended for large infrastructure projects

6:09

and the most common, commercial loans

6:11

with higher interest rates

6:13

in line with what you would get from a typical private bank.

6:17

One of the very interesting trends that we see

6:20

when researchers discuss Chinese loans,

6:23

is that there is a tendency to bunch all three together.

6:26

Well, the very first question you should ask yourself

6:28

whenever you see something like that,

6:30

is well, are they comparing apples to oranges?

6:33

Because if you're comparing commercial loans

6:35

to something available from the World Bank

6:37

or one of its different agencies,

6:39

then you're not really comparing like for like.

6:41

And the fact of the matter is this,

6:43

and I hope the borrowers out there are listening,

6:46

95%, if not 99%, the loan agreement

6:49

are there in favor of the lenders,

6:51

no matter who you deal with.

6:53

This is because by the time you sign that loan agreement

6:55

and you get the money, you'll have the money in your hands

6:59

and the only thing the bank will have is a piece of paper.

7:02

That is why the loan agreements are in their favor.

7:06

In one report, which analyzed 100 Chinese contracts,

7:10

it revealed that the loans are structured

7:12

to give an advantage over other creditors

7:14

and allows action to be taken

7:16

if the borrower acts contrary to the interests

7:18

of a People's Republic of China entity.

7:21

There are also unusual clauses

7:23

that shroud agreements in secrecy.

7:26

When you look at multilateral lenders

7:28

like the World Bank and the different agencies,

7:30

their shareholders are countries

7:31

and they're required to publish their lending

7:35

and activities just to be transparent.

7:38

They don't have any choice.

7:39

On the other hand, when you come to commercial banks

7:42

then you'll see a very different case.

7:44

And that is banks often are under a duty of confidentiality

7:48

to their clients.

7:49

I think the Chinese banks are no different.

7:52

But the rush to give out loans by the Chinese

7:54

has meant some of their early investments

7:56

weren't as profitable as projected.

7:59

So when China stepped into the field,

8:01

it was much welcomed by the developing world

8:03

that there would be increased financing for infrastructure.

8:06

However, with the rush to get projects off the ground,

8:09

to put them into action and to begin construction,

8:12

critical due diligence was often left by the wayside;

8:15

financial sustainability,

8:17

social and environmental sustainability assessments

8:20

kind of never were done or were done haphazardly,

8:23

or were simply not transparent

8:25

or available to the populations.

8:27

What this has ended up causing is states to take on projects

8:31

that they initially thought were affordable,

8:33

but unfortunately, they've been now saddled by debt.

8:37

China is coming for its pound of flesh in Uganda.

8:41

In 2021, the Entebbe International Airport in Uganda,

8:45

came under fire after local media reported

8:48

that the airport would be taken over by China.

8:51

We call this a debt-trap.

8:53

After closer examination of the contract,

8:55

it was found there was no debt-trap.

8:57

And both sides have denied that the airport is in danger

9:00

of a takeover.

9:03

I think there is an assumption that certain governments

9:06

are not able to look after themselves, or they're

9:08

either not sophisticated enough

9:10

or just simply too corrupt

9:13

to look after its own interest.

9:14

I think in my personal view and experience,

9:17

that just simply hasn't been true.

9:19

Experts say more should be done by borrowing countries

9:22

to make sure loans are more favorable to their interests.

9:26

But the Chinese argue that the risk level is higher

9:28

in African countries and greater repayment assurances

9:31

are needed for loans that might not otherwise be available.

9:36

Certainly, in my 20 years of experience,

9:38

I've never seen a case where the Chinese bank

9:40

would just say, "Look, don't read this,

9:42

just sign on the dotted line."

9:43

In fact, they will spend days and days

9:46

and they're sitting with us,

9:47

going through every line of the document

9:49

and making sure the other side understands,

9:51

because they know in 10 years time,

9:54

if they don't explain this clearly,

9:55

this is going to come back and haunt them.

9:58

Certainly, there are issues

10:00

with how China finances projects,

10:02

there are issues around transparency,

10:04

but I don't think this is some sort of grand master plan

10:07

from Beijing in order to ensnare developing countries

10:11

into debt and become further beholden to Beijing.

10:16

In Kenya and Nigeria debts to Beijing are growing.

10:20

These include Kenya's $3.6 billion railway

10:23

from Mombasa to Nairobi,

10:24

which reportedly lost $200 million

10:27

in three years of operation.

10:29

And a $1.3 billion loan from the China Exim Bank,

10:33

to fund Nigeria's largest infrastructure project,

10:36

a 157 kilometer segment of the Lagos-Kano railway.

10:41

The government itself can't afford to finance

10:44

these things.

10:45

The private sector isn't really stepping up,

10:48

the West has not got an alternative program.

10:52

So therefore, China is the only game in town

10:57

and the terms of the loans are reasonable.

11:01

At the same time, you have members of The National Assembly,

11:03

particularly, from the main opposition party,

11:06

vocally criticizing the government

11:09

for what they perceive to be a lack of transparency

11:12

around the management of the loans from China.

11:16

They often articulate this worry

11:19

that you hear in other parts of Africa,

11:21

that China will try and seize Nigerian assets

11:26

in the event of a default by the Nigerian government.

11:32

But looking closer at Kenya and Nigeria's

11:34

total public debt, it doesn't appear

11:36

that China's in a position to use the debt it's owed

11:39

as leverage.

11:40

In Kenya, Chinese loans account for about 10%

11:44

of the country's $70 billion total debt.

11:47

And it's even less acute in Nigeria where the Chinese debts

11:50

are just about 3-4%.

11:52

So again, we have to focus on the data as it is,

11:55

not as these narratives and the storytelling

11:58

which we have these fantasies that Kenya

12:01

is going to be taken over by the Chinese.

12:03

One country cannot control another country

12:06

just by owning 4-10% of its debt.

12:09

Only a handful of countries on the African continent

12:12

have a significant amount of debt owed to China.

12:15

And most of them owe much more to private bond markets.

12:19

Africa does not have a Chinese debt problem.

12:21

Angola weights about a third of all Chinese debt in Africa.

12:25

So take Angola out of the issue,

12:27

then you have an even less serious problem in that respect.

12:30

So it's very important that we narrow down this problem

12:33

to be what it is.

12:36

But it only takes one bad deal to affirm Western fears.

12:40

In the Democratic Republic of Congo,

12:42

a controversial method of borrowing

12:44

based on future natural resource revenue,

12:46

has meant some projects have fallen victim to corruption.

12:50

Congo has a very, very significant mining industry.

12:53

It's Africa's biggest producer of copper,

12:56

it's by far the world's biggest producer of cobalt.

12:59

Cobalt is a key ingredient in the rechargeable batteries

13:03

that power electric vehicles.

13:05

You hear politicians talk about Congo

13:08

saying that, "We are to cobalt as Saudi Arabia is to oil."

13:13

However, up until now at least, the benefits

13:19

to government revenue and the benefits

13:21

to the population at large, have been rather limited.

13:28

In 2008, China and the Democratic Republic of Congo,

13:31

agreed that Chinese companies would finance $3 billion

13:35

worth of infrastructure

13:36

and build a $3.2 billion copper and cobalt project,

13:40

whose tax-free profits would repay both investments.

13:43

China with the help of these mines

13:45

has now come to dominate an industry

13:47

at the heart of future technologies.

13:50

And leaked documents reveal millions of dollars

13:52

that flowed from Chinese entities,

13:54

including the multi-billion dollar mining project,

13:57

to the family and associates of Congo's then-president

14:00

Joseph Kabila.

14:02

If the example of Congo applies elsewhere,

14:06

these companies operate

14:08

with a real deliberate lack of transparency.

14:12

And if they find a willing partner in a government,

14:17

as they did in Joseph Kabila's government,

14:19

this lack of transparency can extend to and really envelope

14:24

the relationship between the state

14:27

and these mining companies.

14:31

There is a lot of anxiety in the West

14:34

over China's involvement anywhere really,

14:37

because it's a strong number two to the US.

14:40

And being a superpower and China having very strong links

14:45

with Africa, setting up a lot of logistical supply chains

14:51

in Africa, preparing to expand its trade

14:56

and take it to the next level, is worrisome.

14:59

'Cause whatever happens in Africa

15:02

or whatever happens in Asia,

15:04

ultimately can affect the world order.

15:07

There's a lot at stake.

15:12

Ideology may also be on the line.

15:15

Countries that receive help from the U.S.

15:17

or European multilateral development banks,

15:19

often require values that fall in line

15:21

with democratic nations.

15:23

Anti-corruption, good governance,

15:25

transparency, participation, inclusion,

15:29

these are things that really matter.

15:31

We should want projects that are beneficial

15:34

to the populations, that don't negatively affect them.

15:37

And so while it may hinder the U.S.

15:40

in being able to lend to certain countries,

15:43

I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing.

15:45

When countries in Africa take help from China,

15:48

they're expected to side with, or at least not participate

15:51

in the condemnation of China on key issues, including Taiwan

15:55

and allegations of forced labor in Xinjiang.

15:59

On these sensitive red line issues,

16:01

and Taiwan is certainly one of them,

16:03

this is where the political relationship

16:06

becomes more evident and much more important.

16:08

Africa, more than almost any other region in the world,

16:12

tends to vote as a block

16:14

in major international organizations.

16:16

And tends to express itself as a group,

16:19

if not the whole continent.

16:20

And again, this is the political symbolism

16:22

that's becoming increasingly important to China

16:25

from a region like Africa,

16:27

that is so important to the Chinese,

16:29

much more so in many ways than the resources,

16:32

which again, aren't as important to China,

16:34

simply because they can buy the resources now

16:36

from any number of other places.

16:38

But getting this kind of political support

16:40

is very important in today's geopolitical environment.

16:43

We want to show that a democratic, value-driven approach

16:50

can deliver on the most pressing challenges.

16:53

While the U.S. and Europe haven't attempted

16:55

to try and match China's investment on the continent,

16:58

they have started work to offer alternatives.

17:01

The EU's Global Gateway aims to supply â‚¬300 billion globally

17:06

between 2020 and 2027.

17:09

And Build Back Better World or B3W from the U.S.,

17:13

aims to address the infrastructure needed

17:15

in developing countries.

17:17

Democracies are messy.

17:19

Things take time in democracies.

17:21

So while authoritarian regimes such as China

17:23

are able to speed up the process,

17:26

are able to get things done quicker,

17:28

that doesn't mean it's of a better quality.

17:30

And I think that's really where the U.S. and others

17:33

and through the B3W initiative,

17:35

can really make a difference, is by actually developing

17:39

and building high quality infrastructure.

17:41

We believe in the nations of Africa,

17:44

in the continent-wide spirit

17:45

of entrepreneurship and innovation.

17:48

Yet skeptics of U.S. and European-led projects

17:51

say they're aimed at specifically targeting

17:53

Chinese influence, rather than working

17:55

with African countries as business partners.

17:58

And they lack specific information

18:00

that have many wondering whether or not

18:02

they'll result in significant action in Africa.

18:06

When you talk to the Chinese, they'll tell you

18:08

that, "We have come along way with Africa

18:10

both culturally and economically,

18:13

we have had similar problems as Africa

18:15

and we want to help them grow

18:17

because they were in a position where we were."

18:20

In Africa, the Africans will tell you, "We need the money.

18:24

We have a huge infrastructure gap.

18:27

And it doesn't matter whether the money is blue or red,

18:31

as long as it can do the job, we will accept it."

18:34

When we talk to some of the economists that follow China

18:39

and the African governments, they will tell you

18:41

that there has been benefit

18:43

for these projects overall for Africa.

18:46

How they have been done,

18:50

the terms as well as how these projects have been got,

18:55

is another story.
